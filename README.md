# One-Class-NeuralNetwork
Simplified implementation of one class neural network for nonlinear anomaly detection. 

The implementation is based on the approach described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06360.pdf. I've included several datasets to play with, and will soon include plots to demonstrate functionality (or lack thereof).
