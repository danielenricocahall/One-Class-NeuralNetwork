# One-Class-NeuralNetwork
Simplified implementation of one class neural network for nonlinear anomaly detection. 

The implementation is based on the approach described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06360.pdf. I've included several datasets from ODDS (http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/) to play with, and will soon include plots/visualizations.
